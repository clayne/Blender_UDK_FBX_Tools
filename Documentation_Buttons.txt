Overview of Settings:


UDK FBX Tools Panel:

	-picture-

Export		- opens custom fbx export menu

Initialize Data - creates custom properties required for the tools to work
		- this changes into two buttons once mesh data has been created:
	- Reset - Resets custom mesh data properties to default
	- Clear - Deletes custom mesh data, disabling the editors
		- enables toggle buttons for sg and vn editors
		- which show/hide editors' menus

Match Grid 	- changes the grid scale and grid subdivisions to match it to UDK's units

Debug 		- Shows some mesh statistics in console (will be replaced/removed soon)



Smoothing Groups Editor:

	-picture of panel-
	-picture of 3d view-

Set 		- sets selected face to the smoothing group number selected in the text box

Select Group 	- selects all faces corresponding to the group number

Show Groups 	- Displays group numbers overlay

Selection Only - only display numbers for selected faces



Vertex Normals Editor:

	-picture of panel-
	-picture of 3d view-

Reset - Resets custom normals to match the mesh's (Typically Blender's auto-generated normals)


	Manual Edit:
X, Y, Z 	- normal direction

Face 		- face index for selected vertex normal

Show 		- sets above x, y, z to the current selection's normal

Set 		- sets selection's normal to x,y,z

Real-Time Edit	- changing the values above will update them on selection in real time

Edit All 	- moves all normals for selected vertex instead of using face index


	Transfer Normals: (buggy, don't select overlapping verts for this)


Copy 	- copies selected vertices' normals to a buffer,

Paste 	- pastes buffered normals to the current mesh


	Auto Generation:
Modes:
	Smooth (Default) 	- uses Blender's default generated normals
	Up Vector		- every normal points up
	Bent			- every normal points away from 3d cursor location
	Ground Foliage		- selected normals (ground base) point up, the rest point away from cursor location
	Custom (Angle-Based)	- (slow) custom algorithm that calculates normals based on face angles
				- settings: 
					- Face: dot product threshold for face smoothing pass
					- Vertex: dot product threshold for vertex smoothing pass
*currently disabled:
	Edges			- generate normals based on edges marked as sharp
	Smooth Groups		- generate normals per smoothing group

Reset First 	- resets mesh data list to defaults (same as reset button) before calculating normals
Selected only 	- calculates normals for selected faces only
		- Note: This works differently with Smooth (default) mode, and may be slower


	Display:
Show/Hide Normals 	- enables/disables normals display and display settings buttons

Scale 			- length of lines representing normals
Color 			- change color of the lines
Selection only 		- only display normals for selected faces


Exporter:

	-picture of exporter panel-

Axis flip - 	- static mesh is default (Y up -Z forward), 
		- skeletal mesh is flipped for UDK character import (Z up Y forward)

Smoothing -	- Off : 	- no smoothing is written (probably not a good thing for game-related meshes)
		- Edges: 	- edge smoothing - (part of defaultss, also not good for games)
		- Face (Default) - Blender's default smoothing approach is used (0=flat,1=smooth)
		- Groups 	- export smoothing groups created by this addon

Normals		- From Editor 	: Writes normals generated by Vertex Normals Editor
		- asdn's Addon 	: Writes normals generated by asdn's Recalc Vertex Normals addon
		- Default	: Blender's automatically generated normals

Tangents + Binormals - calculates and exports tangents + binormals from provided normals
		- triangulating the mesh before editing and exporting may make these more accurate, but is not required


(the rest are the same as the default exporter)
